# P2P Car Rental Platform üöó

A decentralized peer-to-peer car rental platform built on the Ethereum blockchain. This platform enables car owners to list their vehicles and renters to book them directly through smart contracts, eliminating the need for traditional intermediaries.

## Vision üéØ

Our vision is to revolutionize the car rental industry by creating a trustless, decentralized ecosystem where:

- Car owners can monetize their idle vehicles
- Renters can access vehicles directly from owners
- Smart contracts handle payments and agreements automatically
- Reduced costs due to elimination of intermediaries
- Enhanced transparency and trust through blockchain technology
